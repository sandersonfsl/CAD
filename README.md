(trammel_of_archimedes folder)

- CAD PROJECT : https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5d519261d39480528aebefb5/w/44c3121f395301a8622d56e4/e/ace2d5bc2dce2d808f341669



# About This Project :

" This project is a computer-aided desing (CAD) to show a trammel of archimedes, also know as an elipsograph "


- What is a Trammel of Archimedes :

    * An ancient mechanism believed to date back the time of Archimedes

    * A machine made to cut, draw in form of an ellipses 


- Mathematics behind it :

    * Diagram :

    <img src="trammel_of_archimedes/images/diagram.png" width=35% height=35%>


    * In the diagram the point C is the Handle Pin (cutter, writer object)

    * A and B are the two sliders 

    * Slider A move along the y coordinate and slider B move along the x coordinate

    * Considering the Handle makes a θ angle with the x-axis, the exact location coordinate of the Handle pin C is :

        x = (AB + BC) x  cosθ    

        y = BC x sinθ
        
        -> considering AB the distance between A to B an BC the the distance between B to C


    * This explicits the ellipse equation :

        X²/(AB + BC)² + y²/(BC)² = 1

## GEAR RATIOS

- CAD PROJECT : https://cad.onshape.com/documents/64d8aac185b49de0cddb7d9c/w/14fca97dc790948d33065727/e/a75f17299a64ab9caf55fb31



# About This Project :

" This project is a computer-aided design (CAD) to help understanding the concept of gear ratio "

- What is a gear ?

    * A gear is a rotating circular machine element with teeths which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque and speed.

    * A 20 tooth gear :

    * A compound gear system :

- Why to use a gear ?

1. Maintain axe rotation synchronized
2. Decrease or increase speed of rotation
3. Reverse Rotation Direction
4. Move rotational motion to a differente axis
5. Increase or Decrease torque



- Gear Ratio 

    * To  understand the concept of gear ratio, imagine a gear without teeth, this means this is a circle. The circumference of a circle is equal to the diameter of the circle multiplied by Pi .
    
    * For Example, a gear with 1 inch diameter, have approximately 3.14 inches of circumference. A second gear with 0.635 inch diameter have approximately 2 inches of circumference.
     
    * Rolling the second gear counter clockwise against the first one will make the first gear to rotate clockwise. 
    
    * The second gear has to spin twice to cover the same distance covered by the first gear, explaining a 2:1 gear ratio

    * In real life gears have teeth , this avoid slippage. To determine gear ratios just divide the number of teeth in the two gears


    Gear Ratio Example :

# Why ?

- Understand gear ratio definition by creating a compound 1:16 CAD gear system








#  1:16 ratio Compound Gear System


- The left most purple 20 teeth gear is the drive (effort) component that transmits rotation to a small blue 10 teeth gear with a 2:1 ratio. This same case occurs 3 more times. The right most blue 10 teeth, the driven (load) gear will have a 1:16 (2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16) gear ratio compared to the drive. Watch the video below :
